## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions

**October 22, 2025:**
- **Decision:** Use Electron (not browser extension)
  - **Rationale:** More control, better performance, desktop integration
  - **Trade-off:** Slower distribution vs Chrome Web Store

- **Decision:** Use Zustand for state management
  - **Rationale:** Simple, performant, no boilerplate
  - **Alternative considered:** Redux (too complex)

- **Decision:** SQLite for local storage
  - **Rationale:** Fast, embedded, perfect for local-first
  - **Alternative considered:** IndexedDB (less mature tools)

### Design Decisions

**October 22, 2025:**
- **Decision:** Scandinavian design philosophy
  - **Rationale:** Timeless, calm, functional - perfect for thought work
  - **Inspiration:** Linear, Arc, Obsidian
